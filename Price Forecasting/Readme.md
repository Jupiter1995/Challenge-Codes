### Sales Forecasting with Price & Promotion effects 
We Our sales are very seasonal, and we make our money during holidays like Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.
In addition, we run sales promotion for several weeks during the year where we offer discount on the prices.  We have provided 
the base or everyday price and actual price for each week.  Actual prices are either promotion prices when promotion is going 
on or everyday prices otherwise.  Every year, based on increase in the cost of raw materials, we also update our everyday price
to maintain our profitability.  We have provided weekly sales and price data for 10 stores and 3 products. Please forecast for 
next 12 weeks given the actual prices for the three products below (assume the base price does not change)
